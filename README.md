## FLSUN QQ klipper configuration

This repository contains the klipper configuration for my FLSUN QQ printer.

Note that you'll have to be creative in order to use the USB leveling plate provided by FLSUN: Since klipper occupies the USB port of the printer, you cannot connect the leveling plate to USB. So, I just connected ground from my raspberry pi (which runs klipper)  to the ground shield of the USB connector of the leveling plate.
